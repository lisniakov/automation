# Problem and Context of Automation

As with all topics, mine also has not only positive aspects, but I believe that identifying these problems is already half the way to solving them. For a better description and reader perception of this issue, I structure all the pros and cons in this topic point by point. First, I will talk about the difficulties in this area that I consider the main ones:

  - The difficulty of automating this process is that nowadays more and more manufacturers/suppliers/installers of equipment for this area appear every day, which complicates and facilitates the search at the same time. Expanding the choice is undoubtedly good because it is always nice to realize that there is something to give preference to and not just take what is left because there are no other options. Having looked at this same question from the other side, I can say that a large number of proposals are also not so clear because now you need to spend more time and resources on searches because a large number of proposals does not guarantee high quality. In order to sort a potential candidate, it will take a lot of time, which may not be available due to the urgency of the work.

  - The second difficulty will be the next stage of sorting applicants and the main question that should be asked during the search - does the installer perform his work according to the standards set by my company, does his equipment and the equipment he installs meet the standards? After all, for such a responsible area, it is very important to carry out production according to certain standards because human life may be at stake and such an error as a violation of sterility in a clean room can quite possibly become a fatal mistake.

  - This point is unfortunately inevitable but at the same time necessary: when installing the appropriate equipment, production will have to be stopped for some time due to the fact that the clean room will no longer be sterile after the process of building the monitoring system inside; careful cleaning will be required after that.

  - Equipment maintenance (for example, replacement, calibration, qualification, etc.) may take an unknown amount of time since the need for any of these operations does not indicate at all and certainly does not guarantee that the service from the installer’s company will be able to do this at the same or another required day, which may delay production, deliveries, or stop the process for a longer time than planned.

  - On top of that, equipment maintenance is an additional expense, which will have to be spent quite often.

## Advantages

And now I want to tell you about the advantages that I see in my concept and I believe that with this concept I can overcome almost all the difficulties described above. I'm also structuring this in a list because it will be easier for visual perception.

  - The first and most important thing for me is saving time because by installing your monitoring system yourself without the help of installers from other companies, you can save a lot of time. To install the sensors, all you need is a room plan, the necessary tools for fixing the sensors and connecting them to electricity and an Internet cable, the equipment itself, as was said at the beginning of my blog, is not a problem to find on the Internet, here the problem of sorting is simplified but does not disappear because most manufacturers' sensors there is an information sheet directly on the website or in the online store, which saves time and frees you from communication with many potential candidates for installation by hiring installers.

  - The next important positive point will be cost savings: things like installation, repair, and maintenance no longer require additional employees because such a situation can be easily resolved with the help of the service department, which is usually present in most manufacturing enterprises.

  - Also, saving time consists not only in searching for an installer but also in servicing and calibrating this equipment because, as described in the previous paragraph, this can also be done by the service department located at the enterprise on a permanent basis.

  - “If you want to do something well, do it yourself” - is a saying that is well suited to describe the fact that independent development and installation can be carried out according to all the necessary parameters and criteria - be it standards or the requirements of the company’s management, or work instructions from the manufacturing site.

## Conclusion

Summing up, I can confidently say that independent development and installation provide flexibility and convenience, which is very important for manufacturing enterprises, since not only the success of the company and its earnings depend on the time and resources invested in the work, but in the case of our abstract production company medical equipment is also a life-saver, which in many cases cannot wait. I believe that the mission of people in such enterprises is, first of all, to put patients first and do everything to ensure their comfort and stability. At least for me, this would be a strong enough motivation to do everything to ensure that such a production operates flawlessly and without problems.
