My name is Artem Lisniakov, i am Health Informatics student at Deggendorf Institute of
Technology and I would like to introduce my blog topic, namely the development of a
monitoring system for cleanrooms according to ISO and GMP requirements.
As a student of health informatics, I can relate to the current topic the issue of quality control,
which is directly related to all stages - be it a laboratory, operating room or a cleanroom in
medical or pharmaceutical production. I would like to talk about the last of these in my project.
Unfortunately, not every one of us thinks about the importance of quality control for the final
result, but in fact its presence and level guarantee not only shelf life but also safety for
consumption and use. I believe that this topic is quite relevant for me as a student of health
informatics, because when developing in a similar field and working in it in the future, it is
important to understand your level of responsibility to patients. For this reason, in this project I
would like to describe in more detail the importance of quality control for cleanrooms in
medical device production and hope that this important and always relevant topic will attract
the attention of readers. I would like to show my development of the concept of a monitoring
system for such a room in accordance with the requirements of ISO and GMP standards.
Today, technology is developing in many areas and this area is not exception. Monitoring
systems have become part of many businesses and today there are many options on the
supply market. But why not try to create such a monitoring system yourself? This is exactly
what I will be doing throughout my project and sharing with you ideas about the development
of my concept. Fortunately, nowadays it’s easy to find on the Internet many options for
sensors for monitoring systems that you can program yourself. And at the same time, it is
absolutely not necessary to go to a cleanroom in production to check the system in action,
because this can be done right in your room without leaving home using microcontrollers,
which will appear in my project. Considering that this is not the first time I have been
programming microcontrollers for personal purposes (for example, decorative lighting for
Christmas or controlling the temperature in my friend’s house), this will be a new interesting
step in my development in this area, which I find very useful. Of course, also in this blog you
will find examples of devices with illustrations, code and simply successful interesting
examples that I found while studying this issue. I will be very glad if some of you also find
something useful for yourself in my blog, I hope you will have an interesting time watching my
successes and difficulties in this project!
