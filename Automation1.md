# Problem and Context of Automation

Identifying both the positive aspects and challenges is essential for addressing any topic effectively. In this discussion, I aim to highlight the complexities surrounding automation in a structured manner, outlining both the pros and cons.

## Challenges

1. **Increasing Options**: The proliferation of manufacturers/suppliers/installers complicates and simplifies the search process simultaneously. While having a wide array of choices is beneficial, it also requires more time and resources to evaluate each option thoroughly. Urgent work may suffer due to the time-consuming nature of this selection process.

2. **Adherence to Standards**: Ensuring that installers adhere to company standards and equipment meets required criteria is crucial, particularly in areas where human life is at stake. Maintaining sterility in critical environments, such as clean rooms, is imperative to avoid fatal errors.

3. **Downtime during Installation**: Installation of equipment may necessitate temporary production halts to ensure the clean room's sterility. Subsequent meticulous cleaning becomes essential post-installation.

4. **Uncertainty in Maintenance**: Equipment maintenance, including replacement, calibration, and qualification, poses challenges due to unpredictable timelines. Delays in service may disrupt production schedules and incur additional expenses.

5. **Financial Implications**: Equipment maintenance adds to operational costs, contributing to ongoing expenses for the enterprise.

## Advantages

1. **Time Savings**: Self-installation of monitoring systems minimizes reliance on external installers, thereby saving time. With readily available equipment and online documentation, sorting through options becomes more manageable, streamlining the process.

2. **Cost Efficiency**: Eliminating the need for external installers reduces expenditure on installation, repair, and maintenance. Internal service departments can efficiently handle these tasks, leveraging existing resources.

3. **Efficient Servicing**: Internal service departments can promptly address servicing and calibration needs, ensuring minimal downtime and optimal equipment performance.

4. **Customization and Compliance**: Self-development and installation enable customization to meet specific parameters and criteria, aligning with company standards and regulatory requirements.

In conclusion, independent development and installation offer flexibility and convenience, vital for manufacturing enterprises. The ability to prioritize patient safety and operational efficiency underscores the importance of seamless production processes. Upholding this commitment ensures the smooth operation of critical systems and underscores the dedication to patient well-being.
